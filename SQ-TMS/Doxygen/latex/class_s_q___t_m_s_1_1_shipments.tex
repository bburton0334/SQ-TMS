\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
The purpose of this class is to hold all of the attributes and classes in relation to the shipments carried out by the TMS\+: Transport Management System. 

{\bfseries{Details}}

\mbox{\hyperlink{class_s_q___t_m_s_1_1_shipments}{Shipments}} class holds the shipments\+ID attribue and holds the various classes within it that relate to handeling shipments for the TMS\+: Transportation Managment System. The attributes include\+: Shipments\+Info\+ID. There are three other classes within this main class\+: \mbox{\hyperlink{class_s_q___t_m_s_1_1_shipments_1_1_orders}{Orders}}, \mbox{\hyperlink{class_s_q___t_m_s_1_1_shipments_1_1_carriers}{Carriers}}, \mbox{\hyperlink{class_s_q___t_m_s_1_1_shipments_1_1_trips}{Trips}}.

To validate the update of the shipments ID. 

==============================================================================================================

{\bfseries{Details}}

Updates the shipments\+ID for the shipments class. It will return false if update failed, or it will return true if the shipments\+ID update was a sucsess. It takes two parameters in order to complete this. 
\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em existing} & -\/ {\bfseries{\mbox{\hyperlink{class_s_q___t_m_s_1_1_shipments}{Shipments}}}} -\/ representation of shipments object to change their ID \\
